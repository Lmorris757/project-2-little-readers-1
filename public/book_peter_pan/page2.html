    <div id="textBody"><span>All children, except one, grow up.</span><span> They soon know that they will grow up, and the way Wendy knew was this. </span><span>One
        day when she was two years old she was playing in a garden, and she plucked another flower and ran with it to
        her mother.</span><span> I suppose she must have looked rather delightful, for Mrs. Darling put her hand to her heart and
        cried, “Oh, why can't you remain like this for ever!”</span> <span>This was all that passed between them on the subject, but
        henceforth Wendy knew that she must grow up.</span> <span>You always know after you are two.</span> <span>Two is the beginning of the
        end.</span>
        <span>Of course they lived at 14 [their house number on their street], and until Wendy came her mother was the chief
        one.</span> <span>She was a lovely lady, with a romantic mind and such a sweet mocking mouth.</span> <span>Her romantic mind was like the
        tiny boxes, one within the other, that come from the puzzling East, however many you discover there is always
        one more; and her sweet mocking mouth had one kiss on it that Wendy could never get, though there it was,
        perfectly conspicuous in the right-hand corner.</span>
        <span>The way Mr. Darling won her was this: the many gentlemen who had been boys when she was a girl discovered
        simultaneously that they loved her, and they all ran to her house to propose to her except Mr. Darling, who
        took a cab and nipped in first, and so he got her. He got all of her, except the innermost box and the kiss.</span><span> He
        never knew about the box, and in time he gave up trying for the kiss.</span> <span>Wendy thought Napoleon could have got it,
        but I can picture him trying, and then going off in a passion, slamming the door.</span>
        <span>Mr. Darling used to boast to Wendy that her mother not only loved him but respected him.</span> He was one of those
        deep ones who know about stocks and shares. Of course no one really knows, but he quite seemed to know, and he
        often said stocks were up and shares were down in a way that would have made any woman respect him.
